# WarmSPy (Warm Inflation Scalar Perturbations)

WarmSPy release 1.0 (2023). This code has been written by Gabriele Montefalcone, Vikas Aragam and Dr. Luca Visinelli.

WarmSPy (Warm Scalar Perturbations) is a Python code that provides the solution for the perturbation equations in warm inflationary models and calculates the corresponding scalar power spectrum at the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) horizon crossing.
The code also allows to numerically fit for the so called Scalar Dissipation Function G(Q) which defines the enhancement (suppression) induced by a positive (negative) temperature dependence in the dissipation rate. Overall, the code is designed to 
facilitate the analysis of warm inflation scenarios and help in precisely testing specific inflationary models against current and future constraints from CMB data and beyond.
For more details, please consult our research paper (link below).
